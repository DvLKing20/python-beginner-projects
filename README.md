A collection of simple Python projects I made while learning the basics of programming.

## Projects
- **Calculator** ‚Äì performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, /, %)
- **Real-Time Clock** ‚Äì shows current date, time, and a greeting based on time of day
- **Number-Guessing-Game** A Simple Difficulty Based Number Guessing Game

Each project helped me understand loops, conditionals, input/output, and logic in Python.
